I'm a 1st year Master's student at UW ECE. My interests are in health sensing, ubiquitous computing and human-computer interaction.

Before joining UW, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, where I was advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3X-4YmUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works'>Prof. Weili Deng</a>. I was also fortunate to work with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3X-4YmUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works'>Prof. Weiqing Yang</a>.

<strong style="color: dodgerblue;">I am actively seeking research assistant/intern positions for the Spring, Summer, and Fall quarters of 2024!</strong>

Please feel free to contact me at: jiaqing[at]uw[dot]edu.
